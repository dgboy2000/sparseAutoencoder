I am unfortunately submitting a buggy solution since I didn't leave sufficient time for debugging.  The sparse autoencoder notes were very clear to me, and I think you'll find this reflected in sparseAutoencoderCost.m.  I'll explain my progress, my bug, and the steps I'll take to resolve it while you are grading.

The existence of a bug is known because computeNumericalGradient, which has been proven correct by checkNumericalGradient, is only ~70% correlated with my programmed sparseAutoencoderCost gradient (when using only the least-squares term).  The effect of this is that gradient descent will step in sub-optimal directions, and the algorithm is not guaranteed to behave well.

To continue debugging, I will take these steps:
1. switch from MATLAB-optimized matrix operations to a for-loop of vector operations for clarity
2. print out dimensions of elements along the way for sanity purposes
3. print values of intermediate objects and sanity check
